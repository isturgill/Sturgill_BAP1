# Figure code
This directory contains code and **minimal** data that are small enough in file size to be hosted on Github; for the figure code alone, total data are over 7GB. 

Therefore, the purpose of the files hosted here is simply to provide information on the analysis environment (provided by `renv`) and to browse the code and follow along with the provided qmd, pdf, or html documents. 

To be able to fully run the figure and some of the included analysis code, please ensure that you download the following:
