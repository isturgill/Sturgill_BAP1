## Abstract
*BAP1* is a tumor suppressor gene that was originally studied in uveal melanoma (UVM), kidney renal cell clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and malignant mesothelioma (MESO). Aberrant *BAP1* expression is a prominent risk factor for the development of these tumor types and is important in tumor evolution, tumor progression, and tumor-immune interactions. Early analyses focused on single-nucleotide variants, but other alteration types such as larger indels and gene-level copy number (CN) loss can also lead to loss of *BAP1* expression. Here we performed integrated multi-omic analyses using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for 33 cancer types and more than 10,000 individuals. We combined and manually reviewed existing variant calls and new calls derived from a *de novo* local realignment pipeline across multiple independent variant callers including indel callers, increasing detection of high-quality somatic variant calls by 41% from 182 to 257, including 11 indels â‰¥40bp. CN loss was more prevalent than mutations with 1547 samples from 32 cancer types with *BAP1* loss predominantly heterozygous. To understand which alterations were likely impacting *BAP1* activity, we developed a gene expression-based *BAP1* activity score to identify a transcriptional profile associated with *BAP1* loss in cancer. *BAP1* has been proposed to play a critical role in controlling tumor plasticity and normal cell fate. Using external human and mouse datasets from the liver, we observed that lower *BAP1* activity scores were associated with a less-differentiated phenotype in normal cells. Together, our expanded *BAP1* mutant samples revealed a transcriptional signature in cancer cells that  support the hypothesis that *BAP1* influences cellular plasticity and maintenance of cell identity.
